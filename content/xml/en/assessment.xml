                        <![CDATA[Ezra, a sales representative, provided Dr. Monty with a 60-day evaluation for equipment. It is day 55, and Ezra has just learned that there is a new software upgrade for equipment that enables system functionality that wasn’t previously available during the initial evaluation period. When Ezra informs Dr. Monty about this software upgrade, Dr. Monty requests that his evaluation equipment be upgraded and the evaluation be extended. Ezra agrees to do so. Should Ezra have extended the evaluation?]]>

You know her patients can truly benefit from the new features so you reach out and schedule a dinner with her for tomorrow. Is this the right approach?]]>

                        <![CDATA[<p>Relying on an approval from a past interaction is not the right approach. You must obtain a new approval each time you plan to invite any government employee to a dinner as a business courtesy. Many U.S. government agencies have strict limits on how much their employees can accept business courtesies – with some prohibiting the acceptance of any business courtesy. If Philips is found to be in violation of these limits, we might lose our ability to sell to the U.S. government agencies, which is our largest customer in the largest market. Therefore, to prevent potential violation of these limits, you must always obtain the approval before you offer any business courtesy.</p><p>Note: You can also check the resources on the <a href="https://intranet.philips.com/Pages/gift-and-hospitality-registration-tool.aspx" target="_blank">Legal Compliance Registration Tool</a> page where you can find detailed instructions and guidance. </p>]]>
